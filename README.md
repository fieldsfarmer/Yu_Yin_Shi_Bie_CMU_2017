# Speech Recognition CMU 2017

1.  Explain the diﬀerence between a phone and a phoneme. Give an example of two phones that are considered the same phoneme in English.
  - phone: The unit of the study of the sounds in human speech. The study is called Phonetics, which focusses on the physical properties of sounds, e.g. how they are pronounced, what their spectra look like.
  - phoneme: The smallest unit of speech that can differentiate meaning in a particular language. 
  - The "k" in kit and skill. The first one is aspirated but the second one is unaspirated. These different sounds are nonetheless considered to belong to the same phoneme, because if a speaker used one instead of the other, the meaning of the word would not change: using the aspirated form [kʰ] in skill might sound odd, but the word would still be recognized.
